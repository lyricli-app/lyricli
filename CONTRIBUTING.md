# Contributing to Lyricli

At this moment this is a really small project that I used to revive an
old ruby project and learn swift, it probably has a lot of bad code that
is not in "the swift way", it has no tests and can always be extended to
support more sources.

## The ~~Roadmap~~ ~~Streetmap~~ ~~Pathmap~~ Corridormap

* Writing sources (They're used to automatically obtain artist and song
  name from
* Writing tests
* Improving code to match idiomatic swift
* Improving the documentation
* Extending the lyrics engine to support different lyrics sources
* Improving the build system
